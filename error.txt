①What is a Circular Dependency?
A circular dependency occurs when two or more modules depend on each other.
This is due to the fact that each module is defined in terms of the other (See Figure 1).

②Pythonで「most likely due to a circular import」エラーが出た場合の対処法
コードの「imoprt pandas」で自分自身のファイルを読み込んでいるため、だからエラー文にある
「circular import（循環インポート）」となっているんですね。

Difference Between "Text" and "String" datatype in SQLite
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11938401/difference-between-text-and-string-datatype-in-sqlite


The subtle thing to note here is that SQLite does not enforce the data type of values you put into columns.
 That means that you can put text into a numeric field, and so on.
To understand the difference between your two SQL statements,
check out section 2.1 Determination Of Column Affinity, which maps the column types
you provide to the storage classes SQLite uses.

In this case, the type string gets mapped to storage class NUMERIC via rule 5.
Declaring the field as text in code would tell the DBMS to use the TEXT storage class.
Again, since SQLite does not enforce the types of columns, your code will probably run fine
when storing Strings as a NUMERIC column, as you note.

As an alternative example, you could define a column with type INTERESTING STUFF, and
that would be mapped to the INTEGER storage class, via rule 1.
